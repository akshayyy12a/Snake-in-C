Snake In C !
Welcome to my Final Project for CS50.

For this Final Project, i made a Snake Game in C, playable in the terminal.

Fonctionality: 

.You control a snake made of # in a map.
.A fruit made of @ spawns randomly in the map.
.The snake can eat the fruits, and so his lenght is incremented by 1, and the score by 10.
.The score is updated in real time and is displayed beside the map.
.Game ends, when the snake hit himself or the edges of the map.

RULES:
.Use ZQSD to move the snake.
.Eat the fruits to gain length.
.DO NOT HIT THE WALLS OR YOURSELF.

DOWNLOADING THE GAME

To play Snake in C, you have to download the source code and compile it.

Prerequisites: 
.A compiler like "gcc".
.An terminal to execute the game.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Clone this repository on your computer.

2. In your terminal "cd" inside the project Folder

3. Compile the code using gcc (like this: "gcc -o snake snake.c").

4. Execute the game in your terminal (like this: ./snake).

LAST PART:

ENJOY THE GAME !

The Game has been coding entirely in C.

I used multiples libraries, like curses.h (because i made it on linux), stdbool.h and more.

I made it usable in the terminal so it is easy to play.
